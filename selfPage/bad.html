<p>A blossoming youth with a burning fire to begin making a difference in the world. For 5 years I have been in a cocoon, cultivating my ability to create via computation. I have been in a state of observation, learning about myself and the world through a process of rigorous discipline. I have been learning how to learn and how to think critically. However, I can no longer suppress the desire to create, to produce, to see my thoughts manifest into reality.</p>

<h2>A Little History</h2>
<p>A Student in his last semester of a computing science degree at University of Alberta, Edmonton Canada. I grew up in Yellowknife, NT, which is far north in Canada. Thus far in my life I have had several passions; basketball, math, physical training, competitive gaming - Warcraft 3 Starcraft 2 and Super Smash Bros. Melee - cooking, yoga, school work, and the exploration of thought.</p>
<h2>Current Work</h2>
<p>Currently I am in my final semester of my Undergraduate degree. There are two school projects I am currently invloved in. Firstly, A Probabilistic Graphical Model approach to arm movement preditcion using EEG data, in particular, using Hidden Markov Models for this task. Secondly, I am involved in a web project which is re-implementing the diaspora project.</p>
