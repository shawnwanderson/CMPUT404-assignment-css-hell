  <hi>chatter, just kidding - something like 'friend time' in greek, concatonated into one word.

"Talk to the world" app with some clever marketing name like facebook google or twitter. A name that is related if you think of it, but you would never be able to guess what the product they provide is doing.. The App maintains open conversations with a user and the world. Each peice of dialogue will be a real users speech but it will get spliced up and proccessed, ie labeled with metaData such as etymological data, dialogue structure data, and verbal inflection that it can be matched with similar conversations as to create a fluid dynamic conversation between a user and what would sound like another user, but giving very engageing insightful responses back. Or fighting with you if you want to fight. You have any conversation you want with a good friend, or bitch about celebrities or watch the game with friends. It will be real people that have real similarites with the things they want to talk about. The potential of archiving this vocal data and farming it to apply machine learning and other probibilistic methods, the business model would be very similar to that of many internet successes, thus might be able to be familiar to investors. Microsoft is so smart farming phone conversations.

I think it takes about 4 to 12 months to really form an addiction to the pump. I say that because I would guess that more than 90% of people trully do not enjoy working out in the moment. They may like working out for some of the many other reasons people do it, ie. health benefits, endorphins, aesthetics, social activity, meditation, ect. But I think it takes about 4 to 12 months for people to begin to really enjoy it in the moment, feeling that preasure of the fifth rep of a bench press set, feeling that voice of failure screaming in their ear but overcome it, feeling trully engaged with their body as a pilot of a machine. This pleasure is what increases the intensity of craving the gym to be the most segnificant factor in the aggregate of brain signals that would invoke a person to workout. It's similar to video games. There are games you play in order to acheive something or discover something. For example the reasons that I love Japanese role playing games, for the most part, is not because I enjoy playing it in the moment. It is almost soulely a combination of both wanting to reveal the story and character plot and to acheive greatness in the game - that is a high level, gear, side quest completion, item collection, 100% completion. When I was a kid it was called wrapping a game. Do people still say that? I wonder if that was most people of my generation, or perhaps just my region, or perhaps just my circle of friends. Anyways.. there are other games that you play for pleasure in the moment. Games like melee, f-zero gx, racing games in general, Tony Hawk games, StarCraft and other RTS's, and MOBAs. I think the very succesful games of our time such as league of legends, Counter Strike, Dota, and fighting games and such, (I think of this as being broken into by World of Warcraft), have been so successful because they have unionized these three appealing factors - Acheivment, Discovery, Pleasure in the moment - Discovery can be discussed in much more detail, that is composed of many avenues of thought.
